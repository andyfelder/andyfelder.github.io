**What challenges will the Treasurer's Office face because of the pandemic and
how can they be addressed?**

First and foremost is ensuring the safety of our residents and employees. As a
member of city council, we enacted nine resolutions in response to COVID-19.
These resolutions aimed to protect our community, guide the reopening of the
city, and assist local businesses.  I plan to use this experience to safeguard
our community.

Second, the economic impact of the pandemic coupled with DTE's property
reassessment will need to be handled. The Treasurer's Office must maintain an
investment policy which accounts for these changes. As a city councilor, in
response to DTE's tax reassessment, we put over $3 million into a reserve fund
without layoffs or raising property taxes. I will use this balanced approach to
help safely navigate Monroe County through this pandemic.
